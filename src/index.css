/* 
  A quick note to address questions that may come up about why I'm using class-based 
  styling like this in combination with the Emotion library: I found out the hard way 
  while working on this demo that there are current issues with the CSS prop in Emotion
  in React 17 (https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/issues/2041), so I decided that this
  was the fastest approach to deal with styling in cases where I would do so using the css prop, 
  vs styled components.
