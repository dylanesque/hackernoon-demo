# User Stories

- I can see all elements present in the example article also present in the reproduction

- Styling in the reproduction will be as similar to the Hackernoon site as I can make it, including responsiveness

# Notes

- I'm not concerned about it for a quick and dirty demo like this one, but I would avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in production code. If time allows, I'll research and make an adjustment that protects against XSS attacks for this code.
